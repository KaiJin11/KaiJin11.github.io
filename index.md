# [](#header-1) About Me  

<img src="https://github.com/KaiJin11/KaiJin11.github.io/blob/master/headshot.jpeg" width="200">

My name is Kai Jin and I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Statistics 
Science Program at the **University of California, Davis**. Im currently working for UC
Davis Center for Water-Energy as a Data Scientist Intern in charge of aligning, 
integrating, visualizing and analyzing California water, energy, and 
environmental data sets. 

I have previously worked as the Research Analyst with Professors at the Pennsylvania 
State University for a research on modeling ant movement in charge of collecting and
analyzing date regarding ant movement and interactions to prevent the spread of 
infectious diseases. Through those jobs, I have gained more knowledge on translating
complex mathematical concepts and presenting ideas in a systemic and efficient 
way. I am interested in pursuing a data scientist or a statistical analysis position. 
I am proficient with R, Python, Sql, Excel. I also have previous experience using Minitab, 
SAS, C++, ploty, R Shiny.

## [](#header-2)Crops Water Usage at San Joaquin Valley 

Our topic is to analysis water uses of crops in San Joaquin Valley, California. Drought has stocked California for the past 6 years and it has been eased a little bit due to recent rain. However, the sever effect from drought are still influencing California. Last Month, NASAS published a report about lands in San Joaquin Valley are sinking into the grouped. Some areas sunk for more than a feet in a year. It is caused by the fact that too much ground water draw from the ground and most of those water goes into agriculture.
In the main time, about13% of US agriculture production came from San Joaquin Valley. It is a challenge to find the balance between reduces water uses in agriculture and keep the production of crops going. We got help from UC Davis Water and energy efficiency center and try to investigate the appropriate crops to grow and the trends of changing in crops in the past 6 years. Potentially we want to help governmentâ€™s and farmers decision making and help them to decide the best crop to grow in terms of water usage.
