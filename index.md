# [](#header-1) About Me  


My name is Kai Jin and I am currently a graduate student in the Master of Statistics 
Science Program at the University of California, Davis. Im currently working for UC
Davis Center for Water-Energy as a Data Scientist Intern in charge of aligning, 
integrating, visualizing and analyzing California water, energy, and 
environmental data sets. 
I have previously worked as the Research Analyst with Professors at the Pennsylvania 
State University for a research on modeling ant movement in charge of collecting and
analyzing date regarding ant movement and interactions to prevent the spread of 
infectious diseases. Through those jobs, I have gained more knowledge on translating
complex mathematical concepts and presenting ideas in a systemic and efficient 
way. I am interested in pursuing a data scientist or a statistical analysis position. 
I am proficient with R, Python, Sql, Excel. I also have previous experience using Minitab, 
SAS, C++, ploty, R Shiny.
